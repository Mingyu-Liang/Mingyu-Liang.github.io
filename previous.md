About me
======

I am a first year Ph.D. in [Computer Systems Lab](http://www.csl.cornell.edu/) at Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University, advised by Prof. [Christina Delimitrou](https://www.csl.cornell.edu/~delimitrou/). My research interest lies in cloud computing and computer architecture. Currently I am working on the benchmark and root cause analysis of microservices. Before coming to Cornell, I obtained my B.S. degree in computer science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), working with Prof. [Chao Li](http://cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~lichao/index.html).

Research experience
======
* **Power Oversubscription in an Insecure Data Center**  
_Supervised by Professor Chao Li (SJTU), Dec. 2017 to May. 2019_
    * Designed and evaluated cyber-attacks targeting different network layers in data center
    * Identified and demonstrated Denial of Power and Energy (DOPE) attack, a new threat to provisioned data centers
    * Proposed a threat mitigation framework called Anti-DOPE, which provided 44% shorter average response time and 68.1% better of 90-th percentile tail latency compared with the existing power controlling methods

* **Towards a Generic Index for Real-Time Vector Search**  
_Supervised by Professor Bingsheng He (NUS), Jun. 2018 to Oct. 2018_
    * Proposed the generic index structure for vector collections search and a series of novel techniques including vector signature, residual sorting and dictionary initialization to guarantee the quality of the index
    * Completed the entire code work in C++ and built a demo called “AudioSearcher” for live audio streams
    * Implemented crawler, word2vec model training and audio feature extraction for data preprocessing

* **Coordinated Operation System in Distributed Virtual Reality Environment**  
_Supervised by Professor Shan Fu (SJTU), Mar. 2017 to Nov. 2017_
    * Designed the holistic architecture, especially the logic tree to guarantee the serialization of operations
    * Implemented the cooperative communication and synchronization based on Photon
    * Programmed UI design and functions including teleportation, screen splitting and ray collision using C# in Unity
