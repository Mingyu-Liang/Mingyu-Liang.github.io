== Biography

I received my Ph.D. at Cornell University in 2024, advised by Prof. [http://people.csail.mit.edu/delimitrou/ Christina Delimitrou]. 
I am broadly interested in improving the performance and efficiency of cloud systems. I was a research intern at Google Brain in 2021 and at Meta in 2022, 2024.

Before joining Cornell, I obtained my B.S. degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by Prof. [http://cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~lichao/index.html Chao Li]. 

I am now a software engineer at Google working on LLM performance.
